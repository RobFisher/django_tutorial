I am just working through the Django tutorial here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/

It's helpful to store even this work in Git because
1. I get to see the steps of the tutorial
2. I get to learn how Django and Git fit, e.g. which
   files should be version controlled and which not,
   and what steps need to be performed after a clone
   to get Django working.
